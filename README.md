# KP-Figura
Hello!!!! This is a repo made to share and distribute the KP related skins I made for figura. 

# What is Figura?

Figura is a completely client-side mod for minecraft that allows you to set any custom playermodel with different levels of complexity and lets you see other Figura users' avatars.

# Installation
Warning: Figura only works with licensed Minecraft copies, it will not work on pirate!

1. Install Figura mod
2. Install the desired model from the list above
3. When inside the game, click on the new icon when you're in the pause menu
4. Click "Open Avatars root folder"
5. Drop the model folder into avatars, don't unpack it's contents
6. Back in game, click upload, and other players with Figura will see your model too!

# Help
