# KP-Figura
Hello!!!! This is a repo made to share and distribute the KP related skins I made for figura. 

# Important!

Models tagged with [WIP] are not finished and are in progress, they're there to give a good feel for the progress on them so far :D

# What is Figura?

Figura is a completely client-side mod for minecraft that allows you to set any custom playermodel with different levels of complexity and lets you see other Figura users' avatars.

# Installation
Warning: Figura only works with licensed Minecraft copies, it will not work on pirate!

1. Install Figura mod
2. Install the desired model from the list above
3. When inside the game, click on the new icon when you're in the pause menu
4. Click "Open Avatars root folder"
5. Drop the model folder into avatars, don't unpack it's contents
6. Back in game, click upload, and other players with Figura will see your model too!

# Help

If you're having issues with any of my models, feel free to message me on discord @raddaway, I will respond and help as soon as I'm available!

# Plans for next models

Currently I am planning to make several more, in order of completion

1. Nightcrawler
2. Hazmat suit
3. Hazzy

Models may come slightly sooner or later, depending on how motivated I am to work on each one. Generally, it takes me about a week or so to fully finish one model, though I may come back to older ones to add new stuff or change them slightly.
